    tldr: Restrict access to trusted certificated bundles in the OS image
    detailed: Operating systems maintain a list of trusted certificates (often called
      trust bundles) in file system. These bundles decides which authorities are trusted.
      Subverting these trust controls would essentially allow an adversary to operate
      as a trusted entity. Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either
      warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted programs.
      Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs
      or websites as possessing some level of trust. Examples of such features would
      include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code
      signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it
      has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an
      indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site.

      Information Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the

      application level authorized software, software programs may be decomposed into and monitored at different 
      levels of detail. These levels include applications, application programming interfaces, application modules,
      scripts, system processes, system services, kernel functions, registries, drivers, and dynamic link libraries.

    tldr: The adversary is trying to steal data.
    detailed: Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. Once they’ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. This can include compression and encryption. Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission.

    detailed: Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tactics’ techniques are cross-listed here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses.

    tldr: Adversaries may delete or modify artifacts generated within systems to remove evidence.
    detailed: Adversaries may delete or modify artifacts generated within systems to remove evidence of their presence or hinder defenses. Various artifacts may be created by an adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversary’s actions. Typically these artifacts are used as defensive indicators related to monitored events, such as strings from downloaded files, logs that are generated from user actions, and other data analyzed by defenders. Location, format, and type of artifact (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform. Removal of these indicators may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other processes used to detect intrusion activity. This may compromise the integrity of security solutions by causing notable events to go unreported. This activity may also impede forensic analysis and incident response, due to lack of sufficient data to determine what occurred.

    tldr: Ensure successful file system mounts are collected
    detailed: It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While
      tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media
      may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's
      an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the
      media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also
      have to track successful open , create and truncate system calls requiring write access to a
      file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair
      indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track
      successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the
      audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track
      data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.

    tldr: Ensure discretionary access control permission modification events are collected
    detailed: Monitor changes to file permissions, attributes, ownership and group. The parameters in
      this section track changes for system calls that affect file permissions and attributes. The
      chmod , fchmod and fchmodat system calls affect the permissions associated with a file. The
      chown , fchown , fchownat and lchown system calls affect owner and group attributes on a
      file. The setxattr , lsetxattr , fsetxattr (set extended file attributes) and removexattr ,
      lremovexattr , fremovexattr (remove extended file attributes) control extended file
      attributes. In all cases, an audit record will only be written for non-system user ids (auid >=
      500) and will ignore Daemon events (auid = 4294967295). All audit records will be tagged
      with the identifier "perm_mod." Monitoring for changes in file attributes could alert a system administrator to
      activity that could indicate intruder activity or policy violation.

      sudo command to execute privileged commands, it is possible to monitor changes in scope.
      The file /etc/sudoers will be written to when the file or its attributes have changed. The
      audit records will be tagged with the identifier "scope." Changes in the /etc/sudoers file can indicate that an
      unauthorized change has been made to scope of system administrator activity.

      The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and process as well as
      the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special
      expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained
      through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.
